Eclat hanya berkenaan dengan support, dan tidak dengan confidence serta lift. Perhitungan support pada apriori berhubungan untuk sebagai pembanding suatu barang atau set barang  dengan confidence jika suatu barang atau set barang tersebut akan membeli juga barang lain. Oleh karena itu support apriori boleh hanya 1 item. Tetapi support pada eclat harus lebih dari atau sama dengan 2, karena support bukan sebagai pembanding dengan confidence tetapi ukuran kepopuleran suatu asosiasi 2 item atau lebih\n","\n","Kalau pada apriori mirip dengan logika 'jika', artinya jika barang A dibeli maka kemungkinan B juga dibeli. tetapi logikanya tidak bisa dibalik, jika B dibeli belum tentu A dibeli.\n","\n","Tetapi dalam eclat mirip dengan logika 'jika dan hanya jika', artinya jika barang A dibeli jika dan hanya jika B dibeli.\n","\n","Karena eclat berhubungan mengasosiasikan 2 barang/set, maka:\n","$support(A_1 \\cap A_2
